🔤 3.1 Language Coverage Problem

Most tokenizers are English-biased, leading to:

💥 Token Explosion

🧩 Semantic Fragmentation

💸 Higher Inference Cost

⚠️ 3.2 Common Failure Patterns
🧬 Agglutinative Languages (Turkish, Tamil)

🔪 Excessive subword splitting

📉 Loss of morphological meaning

🪔 Indic Scripts

⚠️ Unicode normalization inconsistencies

🔄 Script-level ambiguity

🈶 CJK Languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)

🔠 Character-level over-fragmentation

🐢 Longer sequence lengths

🔀 3.3 Code-Switching Breakdown

Example:

"मैं AI engineer हूँ"


Issues:

🧩 Mixed-script fragmentation

📈 Inflated token counts

❌ Broken semantic continuity

🔐 3.4 Security & Bias Risks

💸 Higher cost for non-English users

🌐 Cultural underrepresentation

✂️ Prompt truncation bias

⚖️ Fairness & accessibility concerns

🛠️ 3.5 Mitigation Strategies

📚 Language-balanced corpora

🔎 Script-aware normalization

🧠 Separate multilingual vocabularies

🧩 Morphology-aware tokenization

🧪 Token-efficiency benchmarking
