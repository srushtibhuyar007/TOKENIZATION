🔤 3.1 Language Coverage Problem

Most tokenizers are English-biased, leading to:

:- Token Explosion
:- Semantic Fragmentation
:- Higher Inference Cost

⚠️ 3.2 Common Failure Patterns
:- Agglutinative Languages (Turkish, Tamil)
:- Excessive subword splitting
:- Loss of morphological meaning
:- Indic Scripts
:- Unicode normalization inconsistencies
:- Script-level ambiguity
:- CJK Languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
:- Character-level over-fragmentation
:- Longer sequence lengths

🔀 3.3 Code-Switching Breakdown

Example:

"मैं AI engineer हूँ"


Issues:

:- Mixed-script fragmentation
:- Inflated token counts
:- Broken semantic continuity

🔐 3.4 Security & Bias Risks
:- Higher cost for non-English users
:- Cultural underrepresentation
:- Prompt truncation bias
:- Fairness & accessibility concerns

🛠️ 3.5 Mitigation Strategies

:- Language-balanced corpora
:- Script-aware normalization
:-  Separate multilingual vocabularies
:-  Morphology-aware tokenization
:-  Token-efficiency benchmarking
