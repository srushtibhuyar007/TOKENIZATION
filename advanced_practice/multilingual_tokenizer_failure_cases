3. Multilingual Tokenizer Failure Cases
3.1 Language Coverage Problem

Most tokenizers are English-biased, causing:

Token explosion

Semantic fragmentation

Higher inference cost

3.2 Common Failure Patterns
Agglutinative Languages (Turkish, Tamil)

Excessive subword splitting

Indic Scripts

Unicode normalization inconsistencies

CJK Languages

Character-level over-fragmentation

3.3 Code-Switching Breakdown

Example:

"मैं AI engineer हूँ"

Results in mixed-script fragmentation and inflated token counts

3.4 Security & Bias Risks

Higher cost for non-English users

Cultural underrepresentation

Prompt truncation bias

3.5 Mitigation Strategies

Language-balanced corpora

Script-aware normalization

Separate multilingual vocabularies
