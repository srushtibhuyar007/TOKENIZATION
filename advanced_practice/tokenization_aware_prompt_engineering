4. Tokenization-Aware Prompt Engineering
4.1 Why Tokenization Matters in Prompts

Prompt effectiveness is bounded by token budgets and segmentation behavior.

4.2 Prompt Inflation Traps

Bad Prompt:

Explain in extreme detail everything about...

Results in early truncation

4.3 Token-Efficient Prompt Design

Principles:

Prefer shorter synonyms

Avoid redundant adjectives

Use structured bullets

4.4 Token-Aware Few-Shot Design

Examples consume tokens linearly

Compress examples

Use placeholders

4.5 Advanced Techniques
Token Steering

Choosing words that map to fewer tokens

Boundary Alignment

Aligning semantic chunks with token boundaries


Prompt efficiency scales model capability
