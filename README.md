# 💻 TOKENIZATION: The Foundation of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Tokenization is the critical, non-negotiable first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is the process by which raw human language is translated into a numerical format that machine learning models can understand.

## 🧠 What is Tokenization?

At its core, tokenization is the process of breaking down a sequence of text into smaller units called **tokens**.

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Raw Text** | The input (e.g., "I love LLMs!") |
| **Token** | A unit of text (word, subword, character, punctuation) |
| **Token ID** | The unique integer assigned to the token from the model's vocabulary |
| **Goal** | Transform variable-length text into fixed-length integer sequences for model processing. |
