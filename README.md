# TOKENIZATION
# TOKENIZATION: The Foundation of NLP

Tokenization is a fundamental concept in natural language processing (NLP) and plays a crucial role in how computers understand and process human language.

## What is Tokenization?
At its core, tokenization is the process of breaking down a sequence of text into smaller units called "tokens." These tokens can be words, subwords, or even individual characters, depending on the specific tokenization strategy employed. 

The goal is to transform raw text into a format that can be easily understood and processed by machine learning models.
